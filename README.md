This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Features present

- Global immutable state management without using third party libraries
- Post pagination
- Post Editing
- Full responsiveness
- Style reuse with mixins

## Things to improve if more time was available

- Add automated testing using Jasmine and Karma
- Add a theme switch feature (`BodyModificationService` was created with this feature in mind)
- Design custom input fields from scratch (this version is using Angular Material inputs for the post Edit Form)
